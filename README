Javascript cursor position in a textarea or textfield
=====================================================

Essence
-------
  To obtain the text cursor position in textarea or in textfield.
  Cursor position is provided either in characters, or in pixes relative to top left corner of the textarea.

Why
---
  The library can be used for positioning of a completion popup window in a textarea or input text field right
  near current text cursor. Given that long text is wrapped in the textarea, the task is not very trivial.

How
---
  The library tries to model text wrapping in the textarea and to find out relative cursor position.
  The results are not 100% accurate, but really close to it.

  Usage:

  var positioner = new maxkir.CursorPosition(textarea_element, 3);
  alert(positioner.getCursorCoordinates());  // [x, y] position of cursor in textarea in characters
  alert(positioner.getPixelCoordinates());   // [x, y] position of cursor in textarea in pixels

Dependencies
------------
  None, plain javascript code
